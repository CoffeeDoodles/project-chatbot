# DoggoBot
Coded By: Felicia Liabäck Löwstett & Elaine Bergström (Team Turtle!)

For our chatbot we wanted to create DoggoBot for all your doggo companion needs! The idea was to allow the user to choose what kind of dog they would like to have delivered to them.

## The problems

Javascript, javascript, javascript! If we're in the coding elevator then HTML was floor 1, CSS floor 2, and then suddenly we shot up 50 floors to JS, opened the doors and got pushed out to a 50 floor drop! Neither Felicia or I were 100% in understanding what exactly we were doing. While we understood the purpose and function of JS, implementing it ourselves seemed way more challenging. 

We restarted our chat bot 3 times, remaking our questions so they were simpler because the reality is we just aren't advanced enough in our understanding of JS to be able to implement some of the things we originally planned. Like storing the user information to be pulled later on by the bot to a narrowed down answer. For us just getting from one question to the next was pretty difficult.

However, that being said we did eventually grasp how to do that and it became a little easier. When we stopped working together we both agreed to work on JS basics between meetings. We tried to keep the structure of the bot simple, but eventually we figured out how to add extras like delays between the bots multiple replies. And reaching out on stackoverflow to help with a submit button problem (it was not taking us to the final question after being clicked). 

If we had more time we would like add images with the bot so that people could see examples of the different
kind of dogs to choose from. We would of liked to figure out how to make a better way of collecting the information in one source to draw from at the end as well. Or even add a randomizer for images if possible. 

We are proud of what we have managed to accomplish, considering this is our first time ever using JS.
